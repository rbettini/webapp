## Starting the infrastructure provisioning

- Download "Vagrantfile" file on your computer (https://github.com/rbettini/webapp/blob/master/vagrant/Vagrantfile)
- Create a directory to run the vagrant and execute the command bellow in a CMD terminal (or Bash Linux):

  vagrant init


- Replace the Vagrantfile by the Vagrantfile that you have been downloaded.
- Execute this another command in a CMD terminal (or Bash Linux):
  
  vagrant up
  
  
Wait the infrastructure to be provisioned and check it through your local web browser in http://localhost:8080 (should show "Test OK!")


This automation will provision:

- One Linux CentOS7 VM Instance with 4Gb of memory
- Docker installed and running
- One Apache HTTP Server Instance running in Docker Container

Done!
