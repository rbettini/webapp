## Starting the infrastructure provisioning

- Create a directory to run vagrant and execute the command bellow in a CMD terminal (or Bash Linux):

  vagrant init

- Replace the Vagrantfile by the Vagrantfile that you have been downloaded.
- Execute this another command in a CMD terminal (or Bash Linux):
  
  vagrant up
  
  
Wait the infrastructure to be provisioned and check it through your local web browser in http://localhost:8080 (should appear "Test OK!")

Done!
